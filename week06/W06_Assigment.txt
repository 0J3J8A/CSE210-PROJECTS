W06 Assignment: Explain Polymorphism
Student: Juan Jose Aguirre Marin

Instructions
Now that you have learned about the principle of polymorphism, and designed and developed a program using it, return to Canvas and answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):

What is polymorphism and why is it important?
Your response must:

1. Explain the meaning of Polymorphism.
2. Highlight a benefit of Polymorphism.
3. Provide an application of Polymorphism.
4. Use a code example of Polymorphism from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)
5. Thoroughly explain these concepts. (This likely cannot be done in less than 100 words.)

I understand the Polymorphism ("many forms") the way lets one line of code behave
differently based on context, I like the part of the context because is depending
of the class, thats better tha just call a function, is similar but is not the same.
It builds on abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance to make programs flexible.
For example, the overrides method is helpully to change a lot of things withouth change
all the code.

2. The biggest advantage is context-aware behavior without code changes. The program
automatically detects the right behavior, making it adaptable for future modifications
(like adding new shapes).

3. In a graphics program, a single Draw() method call could render circles, squares, 
or triangles differentlyâ€”each shape class provides its own Draw implementation.

4. I'm going to use the learning activity code overrides example.
public class Circle : Shape {
    //MORE CODE
    public override double GetArea() => Math.PI * _radius * _radius; }

orignal code in Shape
public double GetArea(){return 0;}

5. Words: Sice line 16 until 36 are 150 words.
