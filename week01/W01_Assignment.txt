W01 Assignment: Explain Version Control
Student: Jusn Jose Aguirre Marin

Instructions
Now that you have learned about the principle of version control and practiced using Git and GitHub, answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):

What is version control and why is it important?
Your response must:

1-Explain the meaning of Version Control
2-Highlight a benefit of Version Control
3-Example of version control: Describe the way version control might be used on a software development team.
4-Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command)
5-Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)

For me the meaning of Version Control is the best way to organize your work, not only help you to
track, manage and change the code, but help you to see what we need to change, who changed it and also
when it was changed. I never have work like a programmer yet, but I know that the best way to finish a
programm is with a plan, a plan needs to be physic and the version control for me is the way to create a
physic plan, example use the "git status" command, to see what we need to do in the code, with that command
we create the not physic "what we need to do" to a physic message like "On branch main - Changes not staged for commit:"
Another think about the meaning of Version Control for me is the TEAM WORK, if create a coude by myself is challenger
and sometimes frustrating I don't want to imagine how difficult is to do it with a team without communication, for that reason
has this version controler to see what is happening with the code is essential in the communication of the team.

2- The highligth for me is the TEAM WORK, the communication is essential, in this case use the version control to check
what my companions are doing is a good way of communication and also allowed me to udnerstand how I can help in the specific part 
of the project that we are doing.

3- Example is the when a companion created a new repo and then we need to copy that to use it in our owns computers,
usign the  "git clone" command is possible, also with the visual code welcome page.

4- I showed two commands (status and clone)

5- Words: Sice line 16 until 33 are 264 words
