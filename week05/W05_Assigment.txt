W05 Assignment: Explain Inheritance
Student: Juan Jose Aguirre Marin

Instructions
Now that you have learned about the principle of inheritance, and designed and developed a program using it, return to Canvas and answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):

What is inheritance and why is it important?
Your response must:

1. Explain the meaning of Inheritance.
2. Highlight a benefit of Inheritance.
3. Provide an application of Inheritance.
4. Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of 
code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)
5. Thoroughly explain these concepts. (This likely cannot be done in less than 100 words.)

I understand thet Inheritance is a programming principle that allows one class to obtain the 
attributes and methods of another class without having to rewrite them, that means get the same
code without coding more. I read that a example is children inherit certain characteristics from
their parents. A class that inherits from another is called a subclass, and the class being 
inherited from is called a superclass. This feature allows us to reuse code and maintain a cleaner, 
more organized program structure.

2. I think that the primary benefit of inheritance is the clean and organized of the program,
for me is so important to made the things rigth to point, and use this principle is a good way
to do that,also the part to thing in the Rule of thumb, is helpfully to know why is the program 
in that way or why not, also what I need to do to create the superclass.

3. A common application of inheritance is in scenarios where we have a general class that defines
common behavior, and then specialized subclasses that add unique features. For example, the class 
Assignment (as a superclass) and then MathAssignment and WritingAssignment (as a baseclasses) are 
subclasses that inherit from Assignment but add specific features like math problems or writing titles.

4. I'm going to use code of the assigment activity of this week.

public MathAssignment(string studentName, string topic, string textbookSection, string problems): base(studentName, topic)
public WritingAssignment(string studentName, string topic, string title): base(studentName, topic)
public Assignment(string studentName, string topic)

5. Words: Sice line 17 until 38 are 150 words.
